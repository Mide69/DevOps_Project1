Welcome to Day 1 of the Bash Scripting Challenge! Today, we will cover the basics of bash scripting to get you started. Let's dive in:

Task 1: Comments
In bash scripts, comments are used to add explanatory notes or disable certain lines of code. Your task is to create a bash script with comments explaining what the script does.

Task 2: Echo
The echo command is used to display messages on the terminal. Your task is to create a bash script that uses echo to print a message of your choice.

Task 3: Variables
Variables in bash are used to store data and can be referenced by their name. Your task is to create a bash script that declares variables and assigns values to them.

Task 4: Using Variables
Now that you have declared variables, let's use them to perform a simple task. Create a bash script that takes two variables (numbers) as input and prints their sum using those variables.

Task 5: Using Built-in Variables
Bash provides several built-in variables that hold useful information. Your task is to create a bash script that utilizes at least three different built-in variables to display relevant information.

Task 6: Wildcards
Wildcards are special characters used to perform pattern matching when working with files. Your task is to create a bash script that utilizes wildcards to list all the files with a specific extension in a directory.

Submission Instructions:
Create a single bash script that completes all the Tasks mentioned above. Add comments at appropriate places to explain what each part of the script does. Ensure that your script is well-documented and easy to understand.

Steps:
1. Create file - touch day1_challenge.sh
2. open file to edit vim filename
3.
#!/bin/bash

num2=20
sum=$((num1 + num2))
echo "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is $sum"

Task 5: Using Built-in Variables
